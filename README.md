## Description
When We Had The Choice Between Exercises Or Projects And Well... Projects Have More Value When It Comes To Learning, We Got The "Idea" Of Making A Morse Code Translator

## How To Use

This Time I Instantly Yeet You Into The [Menu](#menu) Where You Have A Few Options

- Morse Formatting Guide
- Text To Morse {Via TXT}
- [Morse To Text](#txt-input) {Via TXT}
- [Text To Morse](#user-input) {Via User}
- Morse To Text {Via User}
- Check Dictionary

## TXT
If You Enter A Valid Path And The App Has Permissions To Open And Read It The Entire Text Will Be Translated

## User
Allows You To Type It Directly Into The App

## [Export](#result)
Exports The Result To A New TXT **If Possible** Located Right Next To The Executable

## Note
The Exported TXT Will Be Overridden With Each Export. You Can Provide The Path With Or Without ["]
